Solar Irradiance Prediction using Machine Learning
Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, offer significant potential to meet global power demands while minimizing environmental impact. Solar energy is derived from solar irradiance. However, the variable and intermittent nature of solar irradiance presents challenges in making accurate predictions crucial for effectively managing energy systems.

This project aims to comprehend and predict solar irradiance variability by employing five supervised machine learning models: Support Vector Regressor (SVR), NuSVR, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor, LGBM Regressor, and CatBoost Regressor. These models were chosen to conduct regression analysis on the target variable while introducing diversity in learning styles, such as kernelized, neural network, gradient boosting, and decision tree algorithms. This approach aims to evaluate and compare the performance of different algorithms on the dataset.

The machine learning models were trained and tested using a solar irradiance dataset containing various meteorological variables. Evaluation of the models utilized metrics including R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics were selected to measure the proportion of captured variance and the predictive accuracy of the models.

The evaluation results showed that all five models performed robustly, with R² scores ranging from 0.8862 to 0.8891, MSE scores between 0.111 and 0.114, RMSE scores ranging from 0.333 to 0.337, and MAE scores between 0.23 and 0.25. These findings demonstrate the models' ability to accurately predict solar irradiance.

The utilization of these machine learning models holds promise in efficiently utilizing solar technology for the construction and management of solar energy systems.
